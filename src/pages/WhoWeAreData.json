Who We Are

Worldly is a social geography game built around real-time gameplay, friendly competition, and curiosity about the world. Designed to make learning geography engaging and fun, players challenge friends, explore a daily featured country, collect points, and progress through guided learning modules that turn global knowledge into an interactive experience.

Developed by Brooklyn raised singer songwriter Rafi Barides and released on iOS in 2025, Worldly reflects a rare blend of technical skill and creative passion. Rafi is both a software engineer and a musician, deeply fascinated by world geography and challenged himself to be able to draw the world map from memory. He also composed the original music for Worldly, as well as music for an upcoming Turkish video game set to release on Steam/Playstation.

Raised in a Mizrachi family with Levantine roots, Rafi's passion for understanding Middle East and global cultures played a central role in inspiring the game. His musical background spans Eastern maqam traditions, Mizrachi influences, and years performing Jewish music as a wedding and bar mitzvah pianist after studying at the Mir Yeshivah in an ultra-Orthodox environment. Alongside studying computer science, he long held aspirations toward aerospace engineering, reflecting a lifelong curiosity about how complex systems, whether global, musical, or technical, fit together.

Worldly was created from that same curiosity: a belief that learning the world should feel alive, social, and meaningful.
